The current deskbar (http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/) applet for Firefox
only support Firefox 1.x, 2.x. In Firefox 3, a new sqlite-based database is
being used.

The deskbar plugin only works with versions 2.20 and higher.

Place (or, if you're developing - symlink) ff3.py AND deskbar_ff3.py in
~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/modules-2.20-compatible/. Make sure to hit the
"Reload" button within Deskbar preferences for the plugin to show up.

For global installation:
  * Put deskbar_ff3.py in /usr/lib/deskbar-applet/modules-2.20-compatible/
  * Put ff3.py somewhere reachable ;)
